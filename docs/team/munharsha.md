## Description of Project:

PropertyFree is a real estate management application meant for property agents to organize their properties and meetings more efficiently.
Other application can keep track of meetings and schedules but there are relatively few applications that help track properties 
and associate them with meetings with clients.

For our project we hope to make it more streamlined for agents to keep track of their property and have clear information about those properties
and there clients.

##Developers of PropertyFree:

PropertyFree is developed by a group of second year Computer Science Students from the School of Computing, National
University if Singapore. This was developed for the team projects assignment fro the module CS2103 and is a
brown-field project adapting from existing projects.

## My Contributions to PropertyFree

* **Find Meeting Feature**: Added the ability to find meetings based on certain attributes.
  * What it does: allows the user to find meetings based on various parameters and also allows the user to find based on multiple features also.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user might want to find the meeting with ease rather then filtering through the list manually.
  * Highlights: The implementation of this command was challenging as I had to make sure that users are able to find based on multiple number of attributes in different order.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **Delete Meeting Feature**: Added the ability to delete meetings.
  * What it does: allows the user to delete meetings based on the id of the meeting.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to remove meetings that have been cancelled or the user feels is not necessary anymore.
  * Highlights: The implementation was rather straight forward however, there was soem issues faced with zero indexing.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
  * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
  * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
  * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
  * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo
