## Description of Project:

PropertyFree is a real estate management application meant for property agents to organize their properties and meetings more efficiently.
Other application can keep track of meetings and schedules but there are relatively few applications that help track properties 
and associate them with meetings with clients.

For our project we hope to make it more streamlined for agents to keep track of their property and have clear information about those properties
and there clients.

PropertyFree is developed by a group of second year Computer Science Students from the School of Computing, National
University if Singapore. This was developed for the team projects assignment fro the module CS2103 and is a
brown-field project adapting from existing projects.
