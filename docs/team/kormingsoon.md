## Description of Project:

PropertyFree is a real estate management application meant for property agents to organize their properties and meetings more efficiently.
Other application can keep track of meetings and schedules but there are relatively few applications that help track properties 
and associate them with meetings with clients.

For our project we hope to make it more streamlined for agents to keep track of their property and have clear information about those properties
and there clients.

##Developers of PropertyFree:

PropertyFree is developed by a group of second year Computer Science Students from the School of Computing, National
University if Singapore. This was developed for the team projects assignment for the module CS2103 and is a
brown-field project adapting from existing projects.

## My Contributions to PropertyFree

My contribution to PropertyFree is largely two segments:
1. Implementation of `Bidder` and `Seller` functions

2. Overhaul of `Ui` as well as introduction of `Ui` commands to improve constraint of user's preference for command line interface.

Below are the details of my contribution:
* **Code contributed**: 
[RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=kormingsoon&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

#### Bidder and Seller Functions
* **New Feature**: Implemented the `Add` function for `Bidder` and `Seller`
  * **What it does**: allows the user to add and `Bidder` and `Seller`, who are the clients engaged by the user (a Property Agent).
  
  * **Justification**: This feature is pivotal as the other entities, namely, `Bid`, `Property` and `Meeting` all require and interact
  with the `Bidder` and `Seller`. Such as how each`Seller` is required to be tied with a property listed on PropertyFree 
  or how each `Bidder` ties with `Bid`. 
  
  * **Highlights**: 
    - Establishing a way of uniquely identifying `Bidder` and `Seller`, which we eventually decided on `Id` class.
    - Establishing threshold limits for parameters such as `Name` and `Phone`, such the maximum input length acceptable. (e.g `Name` was limited
    to only 26 characters as most name card sizes are limited that way. Given the professionalism required of a Property Agent, 
    name cards are commonly exchanged and hence, a suitable benchmark.)
  * Credits: *To fellow group mate Dianne for creation of the `Id` class which was easily adapted into `Bidder` and `Seller`*

* **New Feature**: Implemented the `Delete` function for `Bidder` and `Seller`
  * **What it does**: allows the user to delete and `Bidder`s and `Seller`s, who are the clients engaged by the user (a Property Agent).
  
  * **Justification**: This feature is important as the user may want to remove certain clients for any reasons such as client's loss of 
  interest or if the deal is already closed. 
  
  * **Highlights**: 
    - Implementing a so-called "cascading" deletion function where the deletion of:
        - `Bidder` also subsequently deletes all `Meeting` and `Bid` that it is tied to. This is done by leveraging on the unique `Id` that is assigned
        to `Bidder` and captured by `Meeting` and `Bids`. This feature is essential because deleting a `Bidder` renders the `Meeting` and `Bid` that it is related
        to, irrelevant.
        
        - `Seller` also subsequently deletes all `Property` that it is tied to. This is done by leveraging on the unique `Id` that is assigned 
        to `Seller` and captured by `Property`. This feature is essential because deleting a `Seller` renders the `Seller` that it is related
        to, irrelevant. Property in turn deletes all `Bid` and `Meeting` (the Property cascading deletion function is implemented by teammate Dianne).

* **New Feature**: Implemented the `Edit` function for `Bidder` and `Seller`
  * **What it does**: allows the user to edit`Bidder` and `Seller`. The user is able to delete either the name, or phone number of the client.
  
  * **Justification**: This feature is important as the user may have to change certain information, 
  such as a typo in the name, or when the client may have changed their phone number. 
  
  * **Highlights**:
  Since PropertyFree assumes that all names (case-sensitive) and phone numbers are unique, which imposed a stricter requirement in terms of the uniqueness of the client 
  relative to the implementation of AB3 (where the user was able to edit the name of a client to be the same as that of another person). There was a need to workaround
  the original implementation. My implementation of the `Edit` function prevents any clients from having the same name or same phone number (uniqueness within a book itself i.e
  the information in `Bidder` is independent of that from `Seller`). 
  
* **New Feature**: Implemented the `Find` function for `Bidder` and `Seller`
  * **What it does**: allows the user to search for `Bidder` and `Seller` according to their name. 
  
  * **Justification**: This feature is important as the user may want to search for certain clients for reference when 
  adding a `Property` or `Bid`, which requires the `Id` of the clients.
    
* **New Feature**: Implemented the `List` function for `Bidder` and `Seller`
  * **What it does**: allows the user to list all `Bidder` and `Seller` without any filter or conditions imposed on the list.
  
  * **Justification**: This feature is important it will allow the user to view the full list of either `Bidder` or `Seller`
  such as after executing `Find` which gives a filtered list of the clients.  
    
#### User Interface Functions

The following functions implemented are all geared at improving the usability of PropertyFree for users who are more
inclined with command line interface. All functions aims to prevent the usage of the mouse for navigation in PropertyFree.

The `CalendarView` (both `.java` and `.fxml`) was referenced from:
- [Senior Team Project](https://github.com/SirGoose3432/javafx-calendar/blob/master/src/FullCalendarView.java) 
- [External Github Repo](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-T10-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/CalendarView.java)

Credit for `CalendarView` has been given and cited accordingly in the file. Only minor modifications was done for `CalendarView` to fit PropertyFree. 
The intention for implementing `CalendarView` into PropertyFree was to increase usability and GUI for the user, to easily reference
date and day while setting up a meeting for example. 
Hence, **the implementation or logic of the code should only be credited to me with a limit (if any). 
My contributions mainly encompasses the `CalendarView.fxml`
and elevating the user experience with the following segment on Ui navigation** 

---
* **New Feature**: Implemented the `AutoTab` switching function for PropertyFree
  * **What it does**: Changes the tab from entity to entity depending on the command executed by the user.
  
  * **Justification**:  Since PropertyFree uses a TabBar interface in JavaFx for displaying the various list of entities,
  the TabBar actually defied the constraint of the user being more inclined with command line interface as the user had to click
  on the various tabs to navigate. Hence, the `AutoTab` feature was implemented to turn this disadvantage around.  
* **New Feature**: Implemented the key-press function for PropertyFree
  * **What it does**: 
    - Pressing `CONTROL (Mac OS) / CTRL` + `RIGHT ARROW KEY`: navigates the calendar to the next month
    - Pressing `CONTROL (Mac OS) / CTRL` + `LEFT ARROW KEY`: navigates the calendar to the previous month
    - Pressing `ENTER` (when the command box is not in focus): automatically focuses on the TextField in 
    command box so that the user is able to type commands.
  
  * **Justification**: The above-mentioned key press functions in PropertyFree helps the user to easily navigate PropertyFree.
  The `CONTROL / CTRL` + `ARROW KEY` button helps the user to easily navigate through the calendar to identify which dates and days are important.
  The `ENTER` aids in the event when the user may not have the cursor in the command box (i.e usage of mouse)

* **New Feature**: Implemented the `next` and `prev` command for navigating the calendar.
  * **What it does**: Changes the `CalendarView` from month to month depending on the command executed by the user.
  
  * **Justification**: On top of the key-press functions implemented above, there was a need to implement the command line function for calendar navigation
  as the keyboard layout varies different from computer to computer. The `next` and `prev` command serve as an alternate option for users
  to navigate the calendar, in the event it is inconvenient for users to use the key press functions (awkward positioning).
  
* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases v`v1.3a`, `v1.3b`, `v1.4` (3 releases) on GitHub
  * Managed the issue tracker on GitHub
  * Managed milestones for `v1.2` and `v1.3`

  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage with respective to `Bidder` and `Seller` commands.

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Initial cosmetic formatting of UserGuide and overall structure of UserGuide.md for team usage: [\#7](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/pull/7)
    * Added documentation for the features:
      `Keyboard Navigation`, `Bidder Commands`, `Seller Commands` and `Calendar Navigation`.
