# CS2103-W14-1: PropertyFree User Guide


## Introduction

PropertyFree is adapted from AB3. It prefers leveraging on Command 
Line Interface for those who are more comfortable with typing than with Graphical User Interface (GUI).

**PropertyFree is a management system for property agents to track and manage their property listing 
details.** It allows users to easily take control of their bookkeeping matters inclusive of seller ask prices, 
bidder buy prices, key details of properties and record keeping of past properties. 

PropertyFree also provides a 
calendar for property agents to manage their schedule be it for property viewings or meeting with clients. 
It is optimized for CLI users so that the bookkeeping can be done faster by typing in commands.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start
